Word cloud
==========

Word cloud is a basic visual representation composed of words used in 
particular text or subject, in which the size of each word indicates its 
frequency or importance. 

Word cloud is going to be used to depict keyword metadata(tags) on websites, or 
to visualize free form text.

Please report bugs in Word cloud to paukuk@gmail.com.

Compatibility
=============

I'm developing Word cloud with Java.version=1.7.0_67. Using other versions of
Java 7.0.x should not be an issue. Even older Javas should
also work, but I have not tried. If you do, let me know how it
behaved.
